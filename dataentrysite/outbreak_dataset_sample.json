Finally, we demonstrate phylogenetically that human SARS-CoV-2 strains have been isolated in animals. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a broad range of mammals, but few fish, birds or reptiles. Susceptible animals could serve as reservoirs of the virus, necessitating careful ongoing animal management and surveillance."},{"source":"Zenodo","_id":"zenodo.3740145","description":"<p>This is a new analytic review on the molecular aspects of L-Carnitine potential effects on prophylaxis of COVID-19-induced morbidities.<\/p>","keywords":["COVID19","Coronavirus","L-Carnitine","Molecular aspects","Respiratory"],"name":"L-Carnitine can extinguish the COVID19 fire:  A review on molecular aspects","abstract":null,"description_abstract":"<p>This is a new analytic review on the molecular aspects of L-Carnitine potential effects on prophylaxis of COVID-19-induced morbidities.<\/p>"},{"source":"Zenodo","_id":"zenodo.3804380","description":"<p>On Thursday, 30 April 2020, the EdTech Hub participated in an &ldquo;Ask me anything&rdquo; session for policy-makers and funders in Nepal.
